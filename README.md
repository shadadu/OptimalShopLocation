# Optimal Shop Location

Some time ago, we went shopping. After discussing with a furniture and decor shop owner their reason for closing their shop and putting their 
remaining inventory on sale, we found that the shop owner believed they'd not picked the best or most optimal location for their shop. 
Sales  had been rather slow; so they were closing the shop and moving it to a location that they had concluded would be 
more ideal for the furniture shop, given the price range of the items and the shoppers' preferences.

What if the shop owner had made the correct analysis and placed their shop in the more optimal location? 
That would have saved them money and time. 

This inspired a project that would determine the optimal location for a shop, given all the possible variables that go
into such determination: income, demographics, distance to shoppers and clientele, etc. Expectedly, small shop owners use rule
of thumb and intuition, and experience and some sales data to determine where to locate their next shop. And giant multi-national shops have analysts using data 
and algorithms to help inform and determine shop locations.

This open-source (MIT License) project intends to replicate the data analysis and algorithmic processes that 
help inform shop locations. For starters, determining shop location demands some economics and econometrics, with some help from
machine learning. We look forward to sharing the data and code as we research and implement the application.
