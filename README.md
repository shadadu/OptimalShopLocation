##                                          Optimal Shop Location

Some time ago, we went shopping. After discussing with a furniture and decor shop owner their reason for closing their shop and putting their 
remaining inventory on sale, we found that the shop owner believed they'd not picked the best or most optimal location for their shop. 
Sales  had been rather slow; so they were closing the shop and moving it to a location that they had concluded would be 
more ideal for the furniture shop, given the price range of the items and the shoppers' preferences.

What if the shop owner had made the correct analysis and placed their shop in the more optimal location? 
That would have saved them money and time. 

This inspired a project that would determine the optimal location for a shop, given all the possible variables that go
into such determination: income, demographics, distance to shoppers and clientele, etc. Expectedly, small shop owners use rule
of thumb and intuition, and experience and some sales data to determine where to locate their next shop. And giant multi-national shops have analysts using data 
and algorithms to help inform and determine shop locations.

This open-source (MIT License) project intends to replicate the data analysis and algorithmic processes that 
help inform shop locations. For starters, determining shop location demands some economics and econometrics, with some help from
machine learning. We look forward to sharing the data and code as we research and implement the application. 


# References andLiterature Review

Quite a bit of research has been conducted on optimal shop location. We would expect most big retailers to have even more 
detailed and comprehensive models and data sets for their research and decision making. Here, we list some of the research

# Modeling

The essential initial methodology is to look at this as a regression problem where we have the dependent variable as 
as the optimal location coordinates (GPS, Geolocation) and the explanatory or control variables include relevant 
radius demographics, income levels of potential customers, competitive retailer factors, target or expected revenue, 
location amenities (i.e., other businesses or social locations that affect traffic), etc. However, given that 
we would have sales data only for locations with relevant retail shops, it may be more fitting to run the regression model
with Expected Sales as the dependent variable and it's relative location as one of the dependent variables. Expectedly, machine learning would also 
help to model the complexity of the data and factors. 

Essentially, we would need sales data of retailer shop at a location, incomes and other demographics
(gender, education levels, employment statuses and industry)  of the population geo-distributions within the vicinity of the shop. 
We would also need data of other amenities in the shop's vicinity i.e., what 
other shops or facilities in the shop's vicinity could enable positive spillover effects in terms of shoppers traffic? Thus, the 
categories and patronage of nearby shops and amenities would also influence the traffic and revenue to a shop.
Competitive effects of similar or alternative category shops would also be captured in the model by including location
facility categories in the model. It also seems that including retail chain or franchise id would be enough to disambiguate
between cannibalization and competitive effects.
